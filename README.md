This project is a simple Twitter-like social media application built using the Laravel framework as part of the Laboratory Midterm Exam. The system allows users to register, log in, and securely authenticate using Laravel’s built-in authentication features. Once logged in, users can create short tweets with a maximum of 280 characters, view tweets from all users, like and unlike posts, and manage their own tweets by editing or deleting them, with an “edited” label appearing when a tweet has been updated. Users can also view profile pages that display their name, join date, total tweets, and total likes received. The project uses three database tables—users, tweets, and likes connected through proper foreign key relationships. It was developed using Laravel 10+, Blade templates, TailwindCSS for styling, and either SQLite or MySQL as the database engine. To run the project, the user must install Composer dependencies, configure the .env file, generate an application key, run the migrations, and then start the Laravel development server with php artisan serve. This project demonstrates CRUD operations, authentication, authorization, andmodel relationships.

Although the system originally worked during early development, with features like authentication, tweeting, and liking functioning properly, later changes to the configuration, migrations, and routes caused the project to break unexpectedly. It eventually began displaying only a blank white screen, and despite many attempts to debug the controllers, routes, migrations, and configuration files, the exact issue could not be located. Because of this, the system was left unfinished. ChatGPT was used throughout the development process to help generate code, explain errors, and provide debugging guidance, but even with this assistance, the project could not be restored back to a working state idk why i gave up sir:((((
